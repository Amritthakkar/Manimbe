{"status": "completed", "prompt": "Create a cinematic 3D animation visualizing the formation of a black hole from a collapsing massive star. Begin with a rotating 3D model of a star with animated plasma waves and solar flares using particle systems. As the star collapses, show spacetime curvature with dynamically morphing grid lines and a gravity well forming underneath. Add surrounding orbiting celestial bodies spiraling inward. As the black hole forms, animate an accretion disk with motion blur and lens flare effects. Include real-time plotted graphs of temperature and gravitational force on the side, updating as the collapse progresses. Zoom the camera in and out with easing transitions, and use dynamic lighting to simulate relativistic effects. Overlay dramatic captions with synced music cues to match key transformation moments.", "created_at": 1747564245.0387387, "title": "Stellar Collapse and Black Hole Formation", "video_url": "https://manim-ai-videos.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/videos/ec808a73-d0e8-4573-9057-5c1580fa1e11.mp4", "video_path": "outputs\\media\\ead26559-63d5-458d-9be4-2523a4297460.mp4", "completed_at": 1747564261.3084288}
